   abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel accurate method for dead-reckoning of wheeled vehicles based only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In the context of intelligent vehicles, robust and accurate dead-reckoning based on the IMU may prove useful to correlate feeds from imaging sensors, to safely navigate through obstructions, or for safe emergency stops in the extreme case of exteroceptive sensors failure. The key components of the method are the Kalman filter and the use of deep neural networks to dynamically adapt the noise parameters of the filter. The method is tested on the KITTI odometry dataset, and our dead-reckoning inertial method based only on the IMU accurately estimates 3D position, velocity, orientation of the vehicle and self-calibrates the IMU biases. We achieve on average a 1.10% translational error and the algorithm competes with top-ranked methods which, by contrast, use LiDAR or stereo vision. We make our implementation open-source at: https://github.com/mbrossar/ai-imu-dr.},

   abstract = {Smartphone with multiple sensors integration has been widely used for navigation. The inertial measurement unit (IMU) embedded in smartphones has been widely used for pedestrian navigation for counting steps. However, it is a challenge to measure the accurate velocity of the vehicle from the smartphone-embedded IMU data with a high noise level. Thus, current vehicle navigation with a smartphone relies substantially on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which provides unreliable positions in urban dense areas due to the blockage and the reflection of GNSS signals. In this study, we propose a smartphone-based positioning method to improve vehicle positioning performance continuously in GNSS-degraded areas through the improvement of IMU velocity estimation. A convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) combined deep learning odometry network, termed DeepOdo, is proposed to estimate the velocity of the vehicle with the IMU and barometer data as the input, rather than the traditional integral of the IMU measurements. Raw sensor data is utilized to boost the robustness. Labels of the DeepOdo are obtained from the integrated GNSS/IÎ¼barometer solutions in the smartphone which significantly simplifies the dataset collection. In GNSS-denied areas, IMU, barometer, and DeepOdo are integrated to provide accurate navigation solutions for the vehicle. Results of the proposed method show 73.14% and 98.33% improvements in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, compared with the non-holonomic constraints (NHCs) aided IMU. Finally, the DeepOdo network is deployed in Android smartphones to demonstrate that the proposed solution can work properly on the mobile platform.},
